# Glibs

Glibs is a web app that takes your existing photos, and tells a "Mad-Libs" style story from them.  We think of it as "Robots Telling Stories from Human Photos"

## Description
When you visit the glibs website, you will be able to choose a narrator, story structure, and then a few of your own photos.  The app will then create a story talking about the photos.  You may also choose to see any other public Glibs instead.

## How to use the app
1) Visit glibs.herokuapp.com (preferably from your phone)
2) Pick a character to tell your story (currently there is only one character, the alien, to tell your story)
3) Choose the story you wish the character to tell.
4) Be entertained! 

## Current Fixes in Progress
1) We're fixing some of the layout issues we've had from using this in-browser on non-mobile devices.  
2) Polish.
